I am saving and organizing my progress in this github. But the main features of my current progress is as follows:\r\n* automatic selling\r\n* automatic looting\r\n* show record of looting\r\n* open config windows for these features with a simple hotkey\r\n\r\n### WHERE TO DOWNLOAD AND USE IT?\r\nCurrently(2014-01-27) the latest version is ver.5.1 stored in 'take3' branch. The tutorial for applying macro is [here](https://github.com/kwagjj/mrmine-macro/blob/take3/how_to_run_macro.md) and the folder containing the files of ver.5.1 is [here](https://github.com/kwagjj/mrmine-macro/tree/take3/versions/5.1)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
