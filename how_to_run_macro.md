HOW TO RUN THE MACRO TUTORIAL

#1. all the version files are in the "./versions" folder. It has been sorted by each version.

#2. each versions has a file named 'snippetcode.js' or in '.txt' file. It doesn't matter. The contetns are pretty much the same. All we have to do for each versions is code the entire code in the 'snippetcode.js'(or .txt) and paste it into the Mr.Mine game page.

#3. How and where to paste the code is the problem then. First, the user must be a chrome user. This is quite obvious since the Mr.Mine game only runs on chrome. So you'd already have chrome anyway.

#4. enter your own mr.mine game.

#5. when your game is loaded(and is showing the view of the inside of the mine, to be specific) press 'Ctrl+Shift+J' in order to open chrome's developer's tool.

#6. A panel will open at the below of your screen. In the top menubar of this panel, there should be a few tabs. Go to 'Source' Tab.

#7. From here's I'll explain with screenshot images. In the image below, you've enetered the 'source' tab of the developer's tool.

#8. You see that little 'slide me open' button? click it.

#9. Now there's a sidebar with a few more stuff. Go to the 'snippets' tab.

#10. If you're new to this function, you'd probably have a blank list. 

#11. Right click on this blank list and click on 'New'.

#12. You would have created a new snippet file and you'll be able to write javascript codes in the blank page next to it.

#13. In this blank page, paste the 'snippetcode.js' contents.

#14. Then press 'Ctrl+S' to save this snippet file and you'll see that an asterisk next to the snippet file name has disappeared. This means any changes made to this snippet file has been saved.

#15. Now its time to run the macro. Click the 'play' button on the right side. Another thin panel will appear at the bottom. No worries, its just the javascript console that proves that the javascript code inthe snippet has been executed. 

#16. Well, this is it. This is how to run the macro of each version. Find the 'snippetcode.js' and run it. How simple! For any errors or notifications that might come handy, refer to the README file in each version.
