==== README FILE ====

this branch is OUT OF DATE. I have worked up to ver.5.1 in this branch and it still does work. The folder with ver.5.1 is : "./initializing/5.1" . You'll find further specific instructions on how to run the ver.5.1 mrmine macro when you get there.

HOWEVER, I've currently moved on to "take3" branch and have selected it the main branch of this git project. For updated versions, please change the branch to 'take3' and have a look at the 'README.TXT' in there.
