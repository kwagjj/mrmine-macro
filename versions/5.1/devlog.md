ISSUES FOUND
  - the game doesn't produce any chests after approx. an hour after the last manual interactions with the game. I believe this cannot be solve by macros. I have to find out the boundary and definition of 'human's manual interaction' means to the game. Is it possible for me to duplicate such thing with JS?
