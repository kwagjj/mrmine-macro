DEVLOPMENT LOG for VER.5.1
==========================================

NEW FEATURES
------------------------

  #1. added auto looting

  #2. changed selling method



ISSUES FOUND
-----------------------------
  - the game doesn't produce any chests after approx. an hour after the last manual interactions with the game. I believe this cannot be solve by macros. I have to find out the boundary and definition of 'human's manual interaction' means to the game. Is it possible for me to duplicate such a thing with JS?



IMPROVEMENTS
-----------------------------
  - could introduce an 'option' window where the user can change the selling/looting interval period.
  - looting: in the log, when opening it, it would be good if it showed how much chests have been looted in total of the existing log.
